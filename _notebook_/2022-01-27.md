# Summary

Reviewed our proposal and noted possible corrections/improvements to it. Assigned students to make each correction on the proposal and mark their work on the file.

# Experimental Set-up

3 paths we can take:
+ Willy suggest: simulation in MATLAB
+ Simulation in HFSS
+ Evaluate with 2x2 mm MIMO testbed

# Introduction

- talk about ITS 
- What is required for ITS?
- Cooperative driving
- Demand for bandwidth
- Solution is mmWave MIMO
- One paragraph for scope of work
- Elaborate more on Jenniferâ€™s abstract

# Motivation of mmWave MIMO for Vehicular Communication

- Overlaps with Introduction 
- Talks about technique, needs to be in theory
- MIMO improves the DOF
- Geometry affects SNR
- Include figure
- Read the slides sent over
- Rayleigh criterion: good places to place antenna
- Longer travel, phase change
- Inner product sum 
- Sink function 
- Antenna spacing affects phase differential 
- Relate d to phi to pi
- Orthogonal 
- Put slide figure in proposal
- Multiple distances where it is optimal
- Explain Rayleigh Criterion why we use it
