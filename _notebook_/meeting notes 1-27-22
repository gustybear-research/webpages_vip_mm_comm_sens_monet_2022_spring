Proposal notes with Professor Zheng
Put space to put who wrote what in header

Image not working; incorrect path used

Revision due next week

3 paths we can take
-Willy suggest: simulation in MATLAB
-Simulation in HFSS
-Evaluate with 2x2 mm MIMO testbed


Introduction

-talk about ITS 
-What is required for ITS?
-Cooperative driving
-Demand for bandwidth
-Solution is mmWave MIMO
-One paragraph for scope of work
-Elaborate more on Jenniferâ€™s abstract

Motion of mmWave MIMO for vehicular communication 
-Overlaps with Introduction 
-Talks about technique, needs to be in theory
-MIMO improves the DOF
-Geometry affects SNR
-Include figure
-Read the slides sent over
-Rayleigh criterion: good places to place antenna
-Longer travel, phase change
-Inner product sum 
-Sink function 
-Antenna spacing affects phase differential 
-Relate d to phi to pi
-Orthogonal 
-Put slide figure in proposal
-Multiple distances where it is optimal
-Explain Rayleigh Criterion why we use it


Proposed Evaluation 
-focus on a real world testbed
-How do we adjust antenna
-2 linear stage
-Motorized
-Put phase array on top and move it along the stage
-Description of how to use stage to move antenna
-Move while CSI measurement


-Next meeting HH488
-Assign data analysis 
-have illustrations
-Make proposal appealing
